INTRODUCTION
============

LuaExceptions is a library that provides higher level functions to handle
exceptions in lua. It uses native lua functions pcall and error.
It's approach is to provide a similar interface to exception mechanisms
that are native in such languages as Java and C++.
LuaException uses try-catch-finally statements.


GETTING STARTED
==============
1. You must initialize LuaClass submodule with:
git submodule init
git submodule update

2. Run "make" to get a list of samples.

3. "make sample-name" to run a sample.


TODO
===

[ ] Print stack trace, when exception is rethrown in finally.
