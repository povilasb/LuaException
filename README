INTRODUCTION
============

LuaExceptions is a library that provides higher level functions to handle
exceptions in lua. It uses native lua functions pcall and error.
It's approach is to provide a similar interface to exception mechanisms
that are native in such languages as Java and C++.
LuaException uses try-catch-finally statements.

TODO

[ ] Print stack trace, when exception is rethrown in finally.
